I'm a highly motivated developer and student from Belgium. I adore building accessible, responsive and performant code. Furthermore, I'm also a huge fan of open-source.

I have been building web apps for about 4 years and absolutely love it. Learning something new every week. Currently focused on Frontend Web Development and a bit of Web Design.
