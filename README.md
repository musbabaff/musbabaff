I am a highly motivated developer and student from Turkey. I love creating code that is accessible, responsive, and performant. I'm also a big fan of open source.

I have been developing web for about 6 years, I am also an entrepreneur and I absolutely love it. I learn something new every week. I'm currently focused on the TOOIN company and a bit of Web Design.
